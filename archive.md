During the course of its Enron investigation, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission obtained the emails of approximately 150 (mostly high-ranking) Enron staff. You can find versions of the dataset — cleaned, deduplicated, and restructured in various ways — hosted by Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, and Duke Law. Related: “What the Enron Emails Say About Us,” published by The New Yorker last week. Nathan Heller writes: The Enron archive “remains one of the country’s largest private e-mail corpora turned public. Its lasting value is less as an account of Enron’s daywork than as a social and linguistic data pool, a record of the way we write online when we’re not preening for the public eye.”

As the basis for his recent study, “Is Running Enough? Reconsidering the Conventional Wisdom about Women Candidates” (paywalled, but a draft is freely available), PhD candidate Peter Bucchianeri compiled a dataset of female candidates in House primary elections from 1972 to 2010. The spreadsheet covers 1,242 candidacies, and includes each candidate’s party, votes garnered in the primary and general elections, the seat’s incumbency status, the district’s demographics, and more.

NBC News has been tracking the president’s visits to his own luxury properties. For each day since Trump took office, the data — available to download at the bottom of the page — tells you which properties he visited and whether any were golf courses. Since February, Trump has visited his properties roughly 10 days a month, including 25 trips to Mar-a-Lago and 42 trips to his golf courses. Related: A similar tracker from The New York Times.

The Densho Digital Repository is an archive of oral histories, photographs, newspaper clippings, and other primary sources relating to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Among the materials: several datasets listing people sent to the internment camps, based on official government records. The largest dataset contains more than 100,000 entries and includes details such as each internee’s “relocation” site, arrival date, hometown, birth year, time spent in Japan, marital status, religion, educational degrees, occupation, and military service. The National Archives hosts the raw data, as well as its documentation.

The National Park Service and Geyser Observation and Study Association have been using water-temperature sensors to track the eruption times of dozens of geysers in Yellowstone — Old Faithful, of course, but also Beehive, Little Squirt, and Narcissus. GeyserTimes.org combines this data with historical logbooks and observations from “geyser gazers” to form what it describes as “the most comprehensive database of geyser eruption and observation data on the internet.”

### Global economic forecasts.

Each September, the United Nations gathers for its annual General Assembly. Among the activities: the General Debate, a series of speeches delivered by the UN’s nearly 200 member states. The statements provide “an invaluable and, largely untapped, source of information on governments’ policy preferences across a wide range of issues over time,” write a trio of researchers who, earlier this year, published the UN General Debate Corpus — a dataset containing the transcripts of 7,701 speeches from 1970 to 2016. The researchers have also published an online tool for exploring and visualizing the dataset. Previously: UN General Assembly votes since 1946 (DIP 2016.07.13). [h/t Ronny Patz]

Last week, a team at NYU announced “the world’s densest urban aerial laser scanning (LiDAR) dataset” — a 1.4-billion-point description of Dublin’s city center. They write: ”At over 300 points per square meter, this is more than 30 times denser than typical LiDAR data and is an order of magnitude denser than any other aerial LiDAR dataset.” The researchers collected the topographical data during a series of criss-crossing flyovers on March 26, 2015. They’ve also published a short, illustrative video. Previously: LiDAR datasets (DIP 2016.05.25) and 3D models (DIP 2017.04.05) of cities and countries around the world. [h/t Darrell Etherington]

You’ve probably seen The Washington Post’s solar eclipse graphics from last Monday. The stellar maps are largely based on an online tool that uses data from NASA's Five Millennium Canon of Solar Eclipses. The tool can (among other things) generate maps and KMZ files describing the paths of the 11,898 solar eclipses Earth will have experienced between and 2000 BCE and 3000 CE. Helpful: NASA’s key to understanding the data terminology.

OpenSNP is a website that lets people publish the results of their genetic tests (such as those sold by 23andMe, deCODEme, FamilyTreeDNA), “find others with similar genetic variations, [get] the latest primary literature on their variations, and help scientists find new associations.” Since 2012, users have uploaded more than 3,000 sets of genetic variants, which you can download individually or in bulk or access via OpenSNP’s API. Users can also list various personal traits, such as eye color, height, coffee consumption, and lactose intolerance. Useful primer: SNP stands for “single nucleotide polymorphism,” the NIH explains. They’re “the most common type of genetic variation”; each one “represents a difference in a single DNA building block, called a nucleotide.”

The Manifesto Project has collected and coded more than 4,000 electoral manifestoes from more than 1,000 political parties in more than 50 countries between 1945 and 2015. For each manifesto, the project’s dataset indicates whether the document expresses support for/against dozens of policies and attitudes, including “market regulation,” a “national way of life”, “environmental protection,” and “anti-imperialism.” You can also browse the manifestoes online. Caveat: The dataset is subject to a somewhat restrictive usage policy. [h/t The Quartz Directory of Essential Data]

“Police pull over more than 50,000 drivers on a typical day, more than 20 million motorists every year. Yet the most common police interaction — the traffic stop — has not been tracked, at least not in any systematic way,” according to the Stanford Open Policing Project. To that end, the group has been collecting and standardizing traffic-stop data from state police agencies across America. Its first data release, published Monday, contains 130 million records from 31 states. The records vary by agency, but the most-complete states include the date, time, location, reason, and outcome of each stop; the driver’s race, gender, and age; whether a search was conducted; and whether the search found contraband. Related: The project’s findings so far. Previously: Raw traffic stop data from a smaller number of states (DIP 2015.10.28).

Beginning in January 2015, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration began requiring U.S. employers to report “all severe work-related injuries, defined as an amputation, in-patient hospitalization, or loss of an eye.” You can download a spreadsheet of these injuries — some 20,000 in 2015 and 2016 combined. It contains the injury dates, descriptions, and outcomes, as well as the employers’ names and locations. Previously: OSHA’s more detailed (but slightly more cumbersome) inspection data and API (DIP 2016.07.13). [Clarification, 2017-06-07/2017-06-14: The dataset dataset reflects "federal OSHA states only.” It excludes “injuries in state plans," which cover private sector employees in 21 states.]

Before Donald Trump began flying on Air Force One, he rode a fleet of private aircraft. Reporters at Bloomberg used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain flight records for three major components of that fleet — a ”Boeing 757 with gold-plated seatbelt buckles, known as Trump Force One during the campaign; a Cessna 750 Citation X jet; and a Sikorsky helicopter”. For each of the more than 1,500 flights taken between August 2010 and November 2016, the dataset contains the date, time, and airport of both the departure and arrival. Trump wasn’t necessarily aboard each of those flights; the dataset does not contain passengers information. Related: Bloomberg’s analysis/maps of the data.

Every quarter after that, they’re required to file activity reports that detail the agencies they lobbied, the topics they covered, and the income they earned. Bulk downloads of both types of reports are available as XML files from the House (going back to 2004) and from the Senate (since 1999). Although they receive the same filings, each chamber “follows different data-cleaning, processing, and editing procedures before storing the data,” according to this recent GAO report.

Last week at BuzzFeed News, we shared a vast trove federal payroll data. Those records — provided by Office of Personnel Management through the Freedom of Information Act — cover more than 40 years and millions of employees. The dataset includes salaries, titles, job types, and demographic variables. In many-but-not-all cases (per OPM’s data release policies), it also includes names. Previously, federal payroll data had been searchable online, but very little was available in downloadable, analysis-friendly formats. Also: Many states – including New York, California, Florida, New Jersey, Minnesota, Arkansas, South Carolina, and Washington – proactively make payroll data available for download. (Some cities, such as Chicago, do, too.)

The website CraftCans.com publishes a database of 2,000+ canned beers. For each beer, the database lists its name, style, brewery, size, alcohol level, and bitterness. The website doesn’t provide a direct download, but — as Jean-Nicholas Hould points out — you can basically just copy-paste the website’s data into your favorite spreadsheet program. Or, if you want something slightly cleaner, you can use this script. Related: This data-profiling tutorial by Hould, which uses the data.

The Chicago Sun-Times has obtained and published an August 2016 copy of the Chicago Police Department’s “Strategic Subject List,” a database that scores nearly 400,000 (unnamed) people on a scale from 10 to 500, based on an algorithm that attempts to estimate their risk of being involved in gun violence (either as a shooter or a victim). The database includes demographic, geographic, criminal history, and other information about the people it ranks. “But the database doesn’t indicate — and the police won’t say — how much weight is given to each factor in computing the scores, which are produced using an algorithm developed at the Illinois Institute of Technology,” according to the Sun-Times.

For each of India’s 36 states and Union Territories, the country’s latest National Family Health Survey includes 114 metrics, such as the percentages of “households using iodized salt” and “men who have comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS.” Unfortunately, the government publishes the reports only as PDFs. But the Hindustan Times has extracted the data for the survey’s eight “women’s empowerment and gender based violence” metrics, including the percentages of “ever-married women who have ever experienced spousal violence” and “women having a bank or savings account that they themselves use.” They’ve published that data as a spreadsheet and used it to construct an interactive Women Empowerment Index.

### One million comic book panels.

https://digitalcomicmuseum.com/

Comic books make use of white space — or gutters — to propel the story forward, relying on readers’ intuitive ability to fill in the gaps between panels. To see whether computers could learn to make the same inferences, a group of computer scientists built a giant corpus of public-domain comics and tried training a series of neural networks on it. (Spoiler: Humans are much better at this.) The underlying dataset contains 1.2 million panels from nearly 200,000 scanned pages of nearly 4,000 books in the Digital Comic Museum, all published during the 1938–1954 “Golden Age” of American comics. It also contains 2.5 million chunks of text extracted from the comics’ speech balloons, thought bubbles, and narration boxes. [h/t Robin Sloan]

Sci-Hub, which describes itself as “the first pirate website in the world to provide mass and public access to tens of millions of research papers,” recently released a list of the 62,835,101 academic papers it has collected. That dataset identifies each paper only by its DOI — a short, unique ID. Helpfully, graduate student Bastian Greshake has extracted the journal name, publisher, and publication ear from those DOIs. Greshake has also combined that data with six months of Sci-Hub download data (previously featured in DIP 2016.05.04), and analyzed the datasets together. Among his findings: Both are “largely made up of recently published articles, with users disproportionately favoring newer articles and 35% of downloaded articles being published after 2013.”

Yasuyuki Aono, an associate professor at Osaka Prefecture University, has collected the historical flowering dates of Kyoto’s Prunus jamasakura cherry trees going all the way back to the 9th century. The dataset is based on “many diaries and chronicles written by Emperors, aristocrats, [governors] and monks,” Aono writes. The dates are those “on which cherry blossom viewing parties had been held or full flowerings had been observed.” Over the past century, Kyoto’s cherry trees have been blooming earlier and earlier.

From Treasury.io: “Every day at 4pm, the United States Treasury publishes data tables summarizing the cash spending, deposits, and borrowing of the federal government.” Those data tables “catalog all the money taken in that day from taxes, the programs, and how much debt the government took out.” On Monday, for instance, the government spent $481 million on the Postal Service. One hitch: The Treasury’s data tables are (subjectively) ugly and (objectively) spreadsheet-unfriendly. So Treasury.io — an open-source civic project — continuously converts the files into good ol’ tabular data. You can download individual tables as CSVs, get the whole dataset as a big SQLite database, or query the API. There’s also a data dictionary and a Twitter bot.

In an early executive order, Donald Trump instructed the Department of Homeland Security to expand its use of Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the federal government to deputize local law enforcement agencies in its search for undocumented immigrants. In response to FOIA requests, DHS has previously released data on the local agencies that participate in the 287(g) program. The Marshall Project has collated the DHS data, which includes the number of immigrants deported, for 2006 to 2013 (the most recent year available). During that timespan, “more than 175,000 people nationwide were deported under the program,” Anna Flagg writes. “More than 30,000 of them came from Maricopa County, Ariz., the most from any single jurisdiction.” [h/t Tom Meagher]

The National Weather Service’s Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) is a 127-year-old network of volunteer weather observers. “More than 8,700 volunteers take observations on farms, in urban and suburban areas, National Parks, seashores, and mountaintops,” according to the NWS. Want to become a volunteer? Because the program is so old, “many areas already have the necessary stations operating,” but “about 200 observers resign each year, about 4 per state.” While you’re waiting, you can download the COOP data from Iowa State University.

For their 2011 paper, “Flavor network and the principles of food pairing,” four scientists analyzed 56,498 recipes downloaded from three websites — allrecipes.com, epicurious.com, and menupan.com. To support their findings, the authors published two datasets. One names the cuisine and ingredients for each recipe. The other dataset counts how often any two ingredients appeared in the same recipe. (Parmesan cheese and beef appeared together 93 times; starfruit and Algerian geranium oil just once.)

The Bank of England publishes a spreadsheet of historical economic data going back, in some cases, to the late 1600s. The country’s GDP in 1700 was £11.7 billion in 2013 prices. That’s about 1/157th the size of the UK’s GDP in 2015. And in November 1694, monthly short-term interest rates were roughly 6%. [h/t Ian Greenleigh]

A team of economists studying “the equality of opportunity” has published new research identifying which colleges “help the most children climb the income ladder.” For their analysis, the researchers combined federal tax records and data from the Department of Education. California State University–Los Angeles was one of the greatest engines of mobility; nearly 1 in 10 students enrolled there began in the bottom 20% of income but reached the top 20% by their early thirties. You can download the findings, which include similar statistics for more than 2,000 schools, as a series of spreadsheets.

Between December 2014 and March 2016, Alberto Cavallo — co-founder of MIT’s Billion Prices Project — sent 323 crowdsourced workers to collect product prices from 56 large retailers in 10 countries. Then, he found the prices for the same products on the retailers’ websites. The results, which contain tens of thousands of observations, are available as several Excel spreadsheets. (Caveat: The dataset’s “Terms of Use” rules stipulate that the information is “EXCLUSIVELY FOR USE IN ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND PUBLICATIONS”.)

Late last year, the USDA published a study that used “point-of-sale transaction data from a leading grocery retailer to examine the food choices” of households receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. In an appendix, the report ranks the total spending on major commodities by SNAP households and non-SNAP households. Soft drinks, “fluid milk products,” and ground beef were the top three commodities purchased by SNAP households. Milk, soft drinks, and cheese were the top three for non-SNAP households. That information is presented as a PDF table, but I’ve converted it to a spreadsheet-friendly text file for you. [h//t Reddit user "junglejuicy"]

In 2015, computer scientist Randy Olson tried computing “the optimal search strategy for finding Waldo” in the seven original Where’s Waldo? books. In doing so, he transcribed a 2013 Slate chart of Waldo’s locations (itself transcribed from those seven original books). The resulting dataset contains 68 rows — one for each Waldo — and four columns: book, page, x coordinate, and y coordinate.

Years ago, Lt. Col. Jenns Robertson began entering information into “a simple Excel spreadsheet that eventually matured into the largest compilation of releasable U.S. air operations data in existence.” Last month, the Department of Defense published a “beta” version of this data, known as Theater History of Operations Reports (THOR). Currently, THOR’s data covers bombing operations from World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. For each bombing, the reports include data about the aircraft, munitions, targets, results, and more.

Scientists expect that, when the final numbers come in, 2016 will have been Earth’s hottest year on record. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration publishes monthly data on “temperature anomalies” — how much hotter or cooler a month was than the 20th century average. (November 2016, the most recent month available, was 0.73° Celsius warmer than the average November.) You can grab the data for the entire globe, by hemisphere, or by continent; for the land and ocean combined, or separately; and going all the way back to 1880.

In September, ProPublica published a Chrome extension that showed readers what Facebook said it knew about them — and then asked readers to share that data. In the following months, readers unearthed more than 52,000 of the “unique interest categories” that Facebook uses for advertising, such as “yoga,” “beer,” and “Scent of a Woman (1992 film).” But ProPublica’s reporters also found that Facebook doesn’t tell users about the “far more sensitive” data it buys about their offline lives, which can include “their income, the types of restaurants they frequent and even how many credit cards are in their wallets.” To support these findings, ProPublica published two key datasets: the crowdsourced “interest categories” and the list of categories that Facebook allows advertisers to target.

Between 2010 and 2015, the proportion of Nevadans without health insurance dropped from 22.6% to 12.3% — the largest percentage-point decrease of any state. (In 2015, an estimated 17.1% of Texans still didn’t have health insurance, the highest rate of any state that year.) The metrics come from various sources, including the Census, academic studies, and the department’s own estimates. [h/t Nadja Popovich]

Forbes found that ShotSpotter has produced “few tangible results.” “In some cities, ShotSpotter hasn’t had the effect city officials and residents had hoped for. While officers are responding to more illegal gunfire, they rarely catch the shooter.” To support its findings, Forbes has published the ShotSpotter data they received from police departments in seven cities: Brockton, Mass.; East Palo Alto, Calif.; Kansas City, Mo.; Milwaukee, Wis.; Omaha, Neb.; San Francisco, Calif.; and Wilmington, N.C. The data varies somewhat for each city, but typically includes the date, time, location, and outcome of the each gunshot alert. [h/t Matt Drange]

### What kills us.

https://wonder.cdc.gov/mortSQL.html

The CDC’s Underlying Cause of Death database provides county-level mortality statistics based on death certificates of U.S. residents for each year from 1999 to 2014. The tool lets you group the data by geography, demographics, place of death (e.g., inpatient hospital, hospice, home, etc.), and other variables. In 2014, for example, about 40,000 residents died of pancreatic cancer — with the highest rates coming in America’s most-rural counties (~15.6 deaths per 100,000 residents) and the lowest rates in country’s most-urban counties (~11.3 per 100,000). The CDC’s “compressed mortality” datasets contain slightly less detail, but go all the way back to 1968. [h/t Drew Ivan]

Earlier this month, New York City published the results of its decennial tree count. You can explore a map of every street tree in NYC — nearly 700,000 of ‘em — or download the corresponding dataset, which contains info on each tree’s species, circumference, health status, and other observations. (Note: That dataset appears to contain about one-third fewer trees than the map’s count, for reasons I can’t quite figure out.) Results of the 1995 and 2005 tree censuses are also available.

Since the 1990s, the FBI has collected data on hate crimes from local law enforcement agencies. On Monday, the bureau released data for 2015, reporting “5,850 criminal incidents and 6,885 related offenses, as being motivated by bias toward race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender, and gender identity.” Those numbers are based on reports from 14,997 participating agencies. On the FBI’s website, you can view and download summary tables of the most recent data. You can also download incident-specific data for 1992 through 2014 from the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data. Unfortunately, as ProPublica noted yesterday, the FBI dataset is “deeply flawed”; more than 3,000 law enforcement agencies don’t participate in the program. [h/t John Templon]

Since 1996, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey has collected data on “the specific health services that Americans use,” and the “health insurance held by and available to U.S. workers.” In a typical year, the survey collects data from more than 30,000 people from more than 10,000 families. In addition to the raw data files, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which runs the survey, also provides summary data tables. They show that, for example, in 2013 an estimated 61% of Americans faced expenses for prescription drugs, which cost the median patient about $278 before insurance. [h/t Ricardo Pietrobon]

The U.S. House of Representatives requires all staff to reveal all “gift travel” — i.e., “free” trips that the government didn’t pay for. The Office of the Clerk compiles those filings into a database containing each trip’s dates and sponsors. (The Consumer Electronics Show paid for 49 staffers and one congressman to visit the Las Vegas convention in January.) The Senate publishes similar data, except it doesn’t include the sponsor name ... which kind of undermines the entire point. [h/t John Stanton]

Since 1999, Jester has been telling jokes. The website, built by UC Berkeley’s Laboratory for Automation Science and Engineering, asks you to rate its sometimes-humorous offerings, and then uses those answers to guess which of the remaining 100+ jokes you’ll like best. The UC Berkeley team behind the project has released millions of joke ratings from more than 100,000 anonymous users. [h/t Alex Gude]

The CDC publishes a searchable database of its cruise ship sanitation inspections — but doesn’t provide an option to download the data. Last week, an open-data enthusiast scraped the database and posted CSVs of specific deficiencies and overall inspection scores since 1990. The lowest score: The Nippon Maru’s 38 points (out of 100) in 1998. Related: ProPublica’s “Cruise Control,” a searchable database of health and safety reports. [h/t Mike Stucka + Lena Groeger]

For 18 years, a trap on the roof of the University of Copenhagen’s Zoological Museum lured moths, butterflies, and beetles to their early deaths. Researchers at the university counted and identified more than 250,000 specimens from 1,500+ species. The most common: Yponomeuta evonymella, a moth species also known as the bird-cherry ermine, which got trapped nearly 40,000 times.

In 2011, agriculture occupied about 22% of all land in the contiguous U.S., according to the National Land Cover Database. The NLCD classifies every 30-meter-by-30-meter chunk of land into one of 16 categories, including “woody wetlands,” “cultivated crops,” and “developed” land, at different intensities. (Alaska’s unique landscape has earned it a few additional categories, such as “dwarf scrub.”) The database is presented as raster files, so you’ll need some geospatial software to dig in.

Computational linguists at Canada’s National Research Council used Mechanical Turk to crowdsource the emotional associations of 14,182 words. For each word, participants were asked whether it was “positive” and/or “negative”, and whether it was associated with any of eight emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust. The resulting Word-Emotion Association Lexicon was first published in 2010. Of the full lexicon, only two words — “treat” and “feeling” — were associated with all eight emotions. [h/t Bipul Mohanto]

Gun dealers use the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System to determine whether someone is allowed to buy a firearm. There isn’t a one-to-one correlation between these background checks and gun sales, but they’re said to be the best available proxy. The FBI publishes a PDF tallying the monthly number of firearm checks for each state and type. At BuzzFeed News, we’ve parsed that PDF into a CSV/spreadsheet for easier use.

The Mother Jones database takes narrower approach, focusing on shootings that killed at least four people in a public setting. In a New York Times op-ed, published shortly after last week’s San Bernardino shooting, the editor behind that database argues that broader methodologies don’t distinguish between a “a 1 a.m. gang fight” and “the madness that just played out in Southern California.” A Washington Post article weighs the pros and cons of broader and narrower approaches.

### Four years of rejected license plates.

WNYC, through a freedom-of-information request to the New York DMV, obtained a list of vanity plate approvals and denials from late 2010 to late 2014. Among the denials: “RUBMYDUB,” “S5SS5S5S,” “RFLMAO,” and “CBSNEWS.” (Strangely, “NBC4” was approved. Go figure.) The files and related story were published in August, but the data are timeless.

### How often do Wikipedia editors edit?

https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/09/25/wikipedia-editor-numbers/

The Wikimedia Foundation has published a dataset enumerating monthly revision counts for every editor, across all of its wikis. The foundation is asking for help investigating a few perplexing trends. For example: Why have the number “very active editors” — those with 100+ edits per month — increased while the number of merely “active” editors have plateaued?

### What police-related data does your city publish?

The Police Open Data Census, created by Code for America fellows in Indianapolis, is tracking “currently available open datasets about police interactions with citizens in the US," including officer-involved shootings, use of force, and citizen complaints. The census currently covers 36 police departments. Related: The NYPD says it will start tracking all officer use-of-force incidents — not just gunfire — next year, the New York Times reports.

### “There’s finally federal data on low-income college graduation rates—but it’s wrong.”

The Hechinger Report casts doubt on the Pell grant graduation numbers contained in the Department of Education’s recently-released College Scorecard. Why the discrepancy? “[W]hile schools are required by law to provide the graduation rates of Pell recipients to any applicants who ask, a loophole protects them from having to report the same figures to the government.” Oof.


### Every place name in the United States.

Sometimes, bureaucracy creates poetry. Since 1890, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names has been cataloguing, standardizing, and promulgating official names for the places we hike, swim, work, and call home. Along the way, it began publishing Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), a searchable and downloadable database containing all of its domestic nomenclature. In Alaska alone, the database lists names for 167 dams, 303 post offices, 666 glaciers, 2,704 capes, and 9,575 streams. My favorite: Confusion Creek. [h/t @emilymbadger]
