https://github.com/ericfischer/housing-inventory/

To help understand San Francisco’s soaring real estate prices, Eric Fischer transcribed decades of apartment and house listings in the San Francisco Chronicle. For each year from 1948 through 1979, Fischer jotted down every monthly rent advertised in the paper on the first Sunday in April. (Similar data for 1979 through 2001 is available from San Francisco’s Housing Study DataBook.) The transcriptions are available on GitHub. [h/t Kendall Taggart + Michael Andersen]

https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis

“There’s software used across the country to predict future criminals. And it’s biased against blacks,” a ProPublica analysis has found. The investigation focused on risk assessments and recidivism in Broward County, Florida, and found that black defendants were more likely than white defendants to be mislabeled as “high risk.” The reporters have published their methodology, code, and the underlying data — including two years of Broward County risk assessments — on GitHub.

Governments around the world have used “LiDAR” — a laser-powered surveying technology — to build impressively precise elevation maps. In many cases, they’ve also released these topographic datasets to the public. The U.S., for instance, publishes gobs of LiDAR data through the Interagency Elevation Inventory. And you can also find LiDAR datasets for the United Kingdom, Spain, Finland, Slovenia, Denmark, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and New York City.

To help monitor drug safety, the FDA collects “adverse event” reports submitted by patients, doctors, and manufacturers. You can download the (anonymized) reports from the FDA directly, but that dataset includes duplicate cases, and sometimes calls the same drug by different names. A group of researchers recently announced that they’ve cleaned up the data — removing duplicates and standardizing nomenclature — so that you don’t have to. The resulting dataset covers 4,245 drugs, more than 17,000 types of reactions, and nearly 5 million case reports. Previously: The SIDER database of pharmaceutical side effects, featured Nov. 11, 2015.

http://clerk.house.gov/public_disc/giftTravel.aspx
http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/g_three_sections_with_teasers/lobbyingdisc.htm#lobbyingdisc=grt

The U.S. House of Representatives requires all staff to reveal all “gift travel” — i.e., “free” trips that the government didn’t pay for. The Office of the Clerk compiles those filings into a database containing each trip’s dates and sponsors. (The Consumer Electronics Show paid for 49 staffers and one congressman to visit the Las Vegas convention in January.) The Senate publishes similar data, except it doesn’t include the sponsor name ... which kind of undermines the entire point. [h/t John Stanton]

### Flight delays.

An under-scrutinized quirk in a little-known, widely-used database “turned a random Kansas farm into a digital hell.” How? The database contains best-guess geographic coordinates for every IP address on the internet. But for millions of IP addresses, the best guess is just somewhere in the United States. And, until recently, the database translated that vague location into the latitude and longitude of a farm in Potwin, Kansas. (Now it points to a lake.)

Researcher Gwern Branwen has assembled an archive of listings posted to “dark net markets". Silk Road is the best-known among the group, but the collection covers scores of other markets, including Amazon Dark and FreeBay. The materials gathered from each site are slightly different; many include product advertisements and seller profiles. Warning: Some of the archives contain pictures, which may include offensive or disturbing imagery. And it’s probably wise to heed Gwern’s caveats: The scrapes “are large, complicated, redundant, and highly error-prone. They cannot be taken at face-value.” [h/t Mike Sconzo]

Want to fly a drone in the United States for non-recreational purposes? You’ll need a “Section 333” exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration, which governs drone activity. The FAA publishes a list of approved exemptions, which Bard College’s Center for the Study of the Drone has converted into a PDF-formatted database. The Verge, in turn, has converted that PDF into an easy-to-use CSV. Related: Last week, the FAA updated its dataset of unmanned aircraft sightings. [h/t Dan Vergano]

The Oklahoma Geological Survey Observatory’s “Catalog of Nuclear Explosions” contains a “nearly complete” list of such detonations — more than 2,000 of them between 1945 and 2006. The dataset roughly (but not precisely) overlaps with the explosions listed in the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s “Nuclear Explosions, 1945–1998” (PDF) report. Both datasets list the date and location of each explosion, the country responsible, the detonation site, and (where known) its explosive yield, among other variables. And both reports use unconventional formatting, so I’ve extracted a couple of CSVs for you.

The NLCD classifies every 30-meter-by-30-meter chunk of land into one of 16 categories, including “woody wetlands,” “cultivated crops,” and “developed” land, at different intensities. (Alaska’s unique landscape has earned it a few additional categories, such as “dwarf scrub.”) The database is presented as raster files, so you’ll need some geospatial software to dig in.

Computational linguists at Canada’s National Research Council used Mechanical Turk to crowdsource the emotional associations of 14,182 words. For each word, participants were asked whether it was “positive” and/or “negative”, and whether it was associated with any of eight emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust. The resulting Word-Emotion Association Lexicon was first published in 2010. Of the full lexicon, only two words — “treat” and “feeling” — were associated with all eight emotions. [h/t Bipul Mohanto]

Gun dealers use the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System to determine whether someone is allowed to buy a firearm. There isn’t a one-to-one correlation between these background checks and gun sales, but they’re said to be the best available proxy. The FBI publishes a PDF tallying the monthly number of firearm checks for each state and type. At BuzzFeed News, we’ve parsed that PDF into a CSV/spreadsheet for easier use.

Among them: government employee earnings, the number of daily visitors to the city’s swimming pools, real-time bus locations, the geography of police beats, and the city’s complete vendor checkbook. [h/t Tom Johnson, who emailed Data Is Plural to praise how Albuquerque is sharing its data: “I have not found any other city in the world doing so in such detail.”]

### The 139,756 side effects of 1,430 medical drugs.

http://sideeffects.embl.de/drugs/3386/

The Side Effect Resource, a.k.a. SIDER, takes all the fine print from drug labels, and aggregates the information about side effects into a searchable, downloadable database. SIDER got a major upgrade last month, and now contains 40% more drug-effect pairs than before. The website incorporates both generic and brand names, so that searches for “Prozac” and “fluoxetine” bring you to the same page.

### Naughty companies.

Good Jobs First’s Violation Tracker calls itself “the first national search engine on corporate misconduct.” The new database currently contains nearly 100,000 penalties for environmental, health, and safety violations — sourced from 13 U.S. regulatory agencies — since 2010. Search results can be downloaded as CSV files, which contain a few additional fields. (Tip: Search for “*” to get all cases.) The largest single fine? The Department of Justice’s $20.8 billion penalty this year against BP. [h/t Samuel Rubenfeld]

### When planes attack.

Last May, a Gulfstream G150 taking off from Houston’s Ellington Airport struck an armadillo. The animal’s remains were collected, but were not sent to the Smithsonian Institution for identification. This anecdote comes from a single row in the Federal Aviation Administration’s Wildlife Strike Database, and draws on just seven of the 94 available fields. The database contains more than 168,000 strikes reported since 1990, almost all involving birds. Roughly 10% of the time, the animal's remains are sent to the Smithsonian's Feather Identification Lab. [h/t Dan Vergano]

 Trans-New Guinea is the world’s third-largest language family. But it’s also among the poorest-studied. TransNewGuinea.org, an online database launched in 2013, is trying to change that. It now contains more than 1,000 New Guinea languages and lists 145,000 word translations — including 1,065 entries for “dog.” It even has an API. A recent PLOS ONE journal article provides additional background and statistics. [h/t Simon J. Greenhill]

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives publishes a searchable and downloadable licensing database. License-holders fall into eleven categories. Among them: run-of-the-mill dealers, ammunition manufacturers, collectors of “curios and relics,” pawnbrokers, and importers of “destructive devices.” The ATF’s website contains monthly and state-by-state archives. [h/t Marc DaCosta] [Correction, 2015-11-04: There are only nine categories of license-holders. The published ATF data includes only eight of them; it does not include "Collector of Curios and Relics." Thanks to @MikeStucka for flagging this mistake.]

This July, the Museum of Modern Art published a dataset containing 120,000 artworks from its catalog, joining the UK’s Tate, the Smithsonian’s Cooper Hewitt, and other forward-thinking museums. The MoMA data contains the names of the artwork and artist, the dates created and acquired, and the medium — but no images. Related: Artist Jer Thorp encourages you to “perform” the data.

The 600+ entries in this searchable, sortable database range from 3M to Amazon to Zynga, and list both paid and unpaid leave. The database, run by the women-in-the-workplace website FairyGodBoss.com, culls from published policies and employee tips. An introductory blog post provides more information.

### Porn.

Sexualitics.org is on a mission: “to contribute to human sexuality understanding through a Big Data approach.” Last year, the site posted detailed metadata on 800,000 adult videos, including titles, descriptions, view counts, and tags. It powers Porngram, an only-kinda-safe-for-work charting tool.

Prior to October 15th, the Census Bureau’s USA Trade Online tool cost $300/year. No longer. The newly-free dataset covers more than 17,000 commodities, including a category for “magic tricks, practical joke articles; parts and accessories.” [h/t Noah Veltman]

### Where do Americans spend their days?

https://www.census.gov/hhes/commuting/data/daytimepop.html
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Buena_Vista,_Florida

Most population numbers tell you where people live. But legions of Americans commute for work across city, county, and state lines. The Census Bureau’s Commuter-Adjusted Daytime Population Data accounts for these daily migrations. Manhattan’s population (non-tourist) population doubles from 1.5 million to 3 million, by far the largest influx by raw numbers. But Lake Buena Vista, Fla., takes the percentage-growth prize. The city’s entire resident population could fit in two sedans, but its “daytime population” includes 33,000 workers — including a not-insubstantial number dressed as Mickey Mouse.

http://www.ri.gov/press/view/23152

This weekend, the New York Times published a front-page article on “the disproportionate risk of driving while black.” Among other findings: “officers were more likely to conduct [searches] when the driver was black, even though they consistently found drugs, guns or other contraband more often if the driver was white.” The investigation drew on several statewide traffic-stop datasets that track the race and gender of stopped drivers. The “seven states with the most sweeping reporting requirements,” in order of how easy it seems (to me) to get detailed data: Connecticut, North Carolina, Missouri, Nebraska, Maryland, Illinois, and Rhode Island.

### Data-shaming the robocallers.

https://github.com/shalecraig/telemarketing

If you can’t beat ‘em, post spreadsheets about ‘em. Earlier this month, the Federal Communications Commission started publishing a dataset of complaints against telemarketers and robocalls. The FCC says the file will be updated weekly. It’s already being put to use: A clever programmer has crammed all the offending numbers into a single phone “contact” so that you can block them all at once. [h/t Shale Craig]

### Four years of rejected license plates.

https://github.com/datanews/license-plates
http://www.wnyc.org/story/new-yorkers-vanity-license-plates/

WNYC, through a freedom-of-information request to the New York DMV, obtained a list of vanity plate approvals and denials from late 2010 to late 2014. Among the denials: “RUBMYDUB,” “S5SS5S5S,” “RFLMAO,” and “CBSNEWS.” (Strangely, “NBC4” was approved. Go figure.) The files and related story were published in August, but the data are timeless. [h/t @veltman]

### How often do Wikipedia editors edit?

https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/09/25/wikipedia-editor-numbers/

The Wikimedia Foundation has published a dataset enumerating monthly revision counts for every editor, across all of its wikis. The foundation is asking for help investigating a few perplexing trends. For example: Why have the number “very active editors” — those with 100+ edits per month — increased while the number of merely “active” editors have plateaued?

### What police-related data does your city publish?

https://codeforamerica.github.io/PoliceOpenDataCensus/
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/nyregion/new-york-police-will-document-virtually-all-instances-of-force.html

The Police Open Data Census, created by Code for America fellows in Indianapolis, is tracking “currently available open datasets about police interactions with citizens in the US," including officer-involved shootings, use of force, and citizen complaints. The census currently covers 36 police departments. Related: The NYPD says it will start tracking all officer use-of-force incidents — not just gunfire — next year, the New York Times reports.

### “There’s finally federal data on low-income college graduation rates—but it’s wrong.”

http://hechingerreport.org/theres-finally-federal-data-on-low-income-college-graduation-rates-but-its-wrong/
https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/

The Hechinger Report casts doubt on the Pell grant graduation numbers contained in the Department of Education’s recently-released College Scorecard. Why the discrepancy? “[W]hile schools are required by law to provide the graduation rates of Pell recipients to any applicants who ask, a loophole protects them from having to report the same figures to the government.” Oof.

Sometimes, bureaucracy creates poetry. Since 1890, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names has been cataloguing, standardizing, and promulgating official names for the places we hike, swim, work, and call home. Along the way, it began publishing Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), a searchable and downloadable database containing all of its domestic nomenclature. In Alaska alone, the database lists names for 167 dams, 303 post offices, 666 glaciers, 2,704 capes, and 9,575 streams. My favorite: Confusion Creek. [h/t @emilymbadger]
