http://www.ncdrisc.org/d-height.html

A group of public health researchers have estimated the average height of adults in 200 countries over the course of a century. Their calculations are based on a re-analysis of 1,472 previous studies, which collectively measured nearly 19 million participants. The resulting dataset contains annual height estimates for both men and women born each year between 1896 and 1996. During that time, South Korean women‚Äôs average height increased by approximately 8 inches, the largest gain of any group. These days, the Netherlands boasts the tallest men, and Latvia the tallest women.

Researcher Gwern Branwen has assembled an archive of listings posted to ‚Äúdark net markets".

The materials gathered from each site are slightly different; many include product advertisements and seller profiles. Warning: Some of the archives contain pictures, which may include offensive or disturbing imagery. And it‚Äôs probably wise to heed Gwern‚Äôs caveats: The scrapes ‚Äúare large, complicated, redundant, and highly error-prone. They cannot be taken at face-value.‚Äù [h/t Mike Sconzo]

What contains 34,052 bottles and is worth an estimated ¬£3 million? The United Kingdom‚Äôs official wine cellar, which provides libations for the government‚Äôs guests and hosts ‚Äî and a dram of data for the public. Between April 2014 and March 2015, the cellar‚Äôs clients consumed more than 5,500 bottles of wine and liquor. Among them: 205 bottles of Champagne, 51-and-a-half bottles of gin, and one bottle Ch√¢teau Pichon-Longueville Comtesse de Lalande 1986. [h/t Nadja Popovich]

Under the HITECH Act of 2009, companies must notify the government of any data breach involving the HIPAA-protected health data of 500 or more people. Summaries of those reports are available at the Department of Health and Human Services‚Äôs Breach Portal, which currently contains more than 1,300 incidents.

For his 1898 book, The Law of Small Numbers, statistician Ladislaus Bortkiewicz tabulated the number of Prussian cavalrymen killed by horse kicks each year between 1875 and 1894. (In total, 196 suffered that tragic fate.) The dataset is tiny, but boasts an outsized legacy: Bortkiewicz‚Äôs lethal horse kicks allegedly helped to popularize the then-obscure Poisson distribution.

The New Mexico city publishes dozens of regularly-updated, well-documented datasets.

The Side Effect Resource, a.k.a. SIDER, takes all the fine print from drug labels, and aggregates the information about side effects into a searchable, downloadable database. SIDER got a major upgrade last month, and now contains 40% more drug-effect pairs than before. The website incorporates both generic and brand names, so that searches for ‚ÄúProzac‚Äù and ‚Äúfluoxetine‚Äù bring you to the same page.

Last May, a Gulfstream G150 taking off from Houston‚Äôs Ellington Airport struck an armadillo. The animal‚Äôs remains were collected, but were not sent to the Smithsonian Institution for identification. This anecdote comes from a single row in the Federal Aviation Administration‚Äôs Wildlife Strike Database, and draws on just seven of the 94 available fields. The database contains more than 168,000 strikes reported since 1990, almost all involving birds. Roughly 10% of the time, the animal's remains are sent to the Smithsonian's Feather Identification Lab. [h/t Dan Vergano]

 Trans-New Guinea is the world‚Äôs third-largest language family. But it‚Äôs also among the poorest-studied. TransNewGuinea.org, an online database launched in 2013, is trying to change that. It now contains more than 1,000 New Guinea languages and lists 145,000 word translations ‚Äî including 1,065 entries for ‚Äúdog.‚Äù It even has an API.

### Where do Americans spend their days?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Buena_Vista,_Florida

Most population numbers tell you where people live. But legions of Americans commute for work across city, county, and state lines. The Census Bureau‚Äôs Commuter-Adjusted Daytime Population Data accounts for these daily migrations. Manhattan‚Äôs population (non-tourist) population doubles from 1.5 million to 3 million, by far the largest influx by raw numbers. But Lake Buena Vista, Fla., takes the percentage-growth prize. The city‚Äôs entire resident population could fit in two sedans, but its ‚Äúdaytime population‚Äù includes 33,000 workers ‚Äî including a not-insubstantial number dressed as Mickey Mouse.

This weekend, the New York Times published a front-page article on ‚Äúthe disproportionate risk of driving while black.‚Äù Among other findings: ‚Äúofficers were more likely to conduct [searches] when the driver was black, even though they consistently found drugs, guns or other contraband more often if the driver was white.‚Äù The investigation drew on several statewide traffic-stop datasets that track the race and gender of stopped drivers. The ‚Äúseven states with the most sweeping reporting requirements,‚Äù in order of how easy it seems (to me) to get detailed data: Connecticut, North Carolina, Missouri, Nebraska, Maryland, Illinois, and Rhode Island.

If you can‚Äôt beat ‚Äòem, post spreadsheets about ‚Äòem. Earlier this month, the Federal Communications Commission started publishing a dataset of complaints against telemarketers and robocalls.

### How often do Wikipedia editors edit?

https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/09/25/wikipedia-editor-numbers/

The Wikimedia Foundation has published a dataset enumerating monthly revision counts for every editor, across all of its wikis. The foundation is asking for help investigating a few perplexing trends. For example: Why have the number ‚Äúvery active editors‚Äù ‚Äî those with 100+ edits per month ‚Äî increased while the number of merely ‚Äúactive‚Äù editors have plateaued?

Sometimes, bureaucracy creates poetry. Since 1890, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names has been cataloguing, standardizing, and promulgating official names for the places we hike, swim, work, and call home. Along the way, it began publishing Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), a searchable and downloadable database containing all of its domestic nomenclature. In Alaska alone, the database lists names for 167 dams, 303 post offices, 666 glaciers, 2,704 capes, and 9,575 streams. My favorite: Confusion Creek. [h/t @emilymbadger]
